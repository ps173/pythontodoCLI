# Todo CLI in python

This is my first python cli projects. It was basically created to make a todo list and enter the data of todo in a text file.  
So it creates a folder of name task folder and then creates the text file according to present date and writes it.  

### Running the file

Make sure you have python installed.  

   $ git clone https://github.com/ps173/pythontodoCLI.git
  
and that should be load the project in your system.  
Next run it in command prompt.

  $ python takhandler.py
  
After providing all tasks and their description you will see a folder named task and it will have a text file of present date.
